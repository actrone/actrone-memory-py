## The Problem This Solves

By default, AI agents are goldfish. They forget everything the moment a conversation ends, and even *during* a long conversation once the context window fills up.

This library gives your agent a **proper memory system**: a fast short-term memory for recent messages, and a long-term memory that stores and searches through everything the agent has ever learned.

```text
Without actrone-memory            With actrone-memory
─────────────────────────         ──────────────────────────────
User: "My name is Alex"           User: "My name is Alex"
AI:   "Hello Alex!"               AI:   "Hello Alex!"

[new session]                     [new session]

User: "What's my name?"           User: "What's my name?"
AI:   "I don't know your name."   AI:   "Your name is Alex."
```

---

## Install

```bash
pip install actrone-memory
```

Recommended for real semantic recall that still runs entirely on your machine:

```bash
pip install "actrone-memory[onnx]"        # in-process ONNX embeddings, no key, no service
```

With framework adapters:

```bash
pip install "actrone-memory[langchain]"   # for LangChain users
pip install "actrone-memory[langgraph]"   # for LangGraph users
pip install "actrone-memory[crewai]"      # for CrewAI users
pip install "actrone-memory[all]"         # everything
```

Sixteen framework adapters are available. See the
[compatibility matrix](#compatibility-matrix) for the full list and tested version ranges.

**You'll need:** Python 3.11+. **That's it.** The default backend is fully local
and in-process, so there are **no services to run and no API key** to get started.
Memory that never phones home.

For durable, horizontally-scalable production, opt into the Redis + Qdrant backend
(see [Going to production](#going-to-production)). Both start instantly with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7.2-alpine
docker run -d -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant:v1.9.2
```

---

## Quickstart: zero services, zero keys

```python
import asyncio
from actrone_memory import create_memory_manager

async def main():
    # Local-first by default: in-memory store + a dependency-free embedder.
    # No Redis, no Qdrant, no OpenAI key required.
    # create_memory_manager() closes the manager for you on exit; use
    # `memory = await MemoryManager.create()` if you want to manage that yourself.
    async with create_memory_manager() as memory:
        # Save what the user said
        await memory.store_turn(
            agent_id   = "my-agent",
            session_id = "session-1",
            user_message      = "My name is Alex and I'm building a trading bot.",
            assistant_message = "Nice to meet you, Alex! What asset class are you targeting?",
        )

        # Before the next reply, fetch everything relevant
        context = await memory.retrieve_context(
            agent_id     = "my-agent",
            session_id   = "session-1",
            query        = "What should I watch out for?",
            token_budget = 4096,   # how many tokens you can spare for memory
        )

        print(f"Loaded {len(context.recent_turns)} recent turns")
        print(f"Loaded {len(context.episodic_memories)} long-term memories")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**What you just got.** The default embedding provider is `local`, which picks the best
offline embedder available and degrades gracefully with no configuration and no key:

```text
fastembed (in-process ONNX)   →   sentence-transformers   →   lexical hashing
   [onnx] extra                      [local] extra              always available
   real semantic recall              real semantic recall       keyword-overlap only
```

With the bare `pip install actrone-memory` you land on the last rung: deterministic
keyword-overlap recall, which is ideal for tests and local dev but is not semantic, and the
library says so once with a warning on stderr. Add `pip install "actrone-memory[onnx]"` for
real semantic recall that still never leaves your machine: "food allergies" then finds "The
user is allergic to peanuts." The first run downloads the model (about 130 MB); later runs
load it from the cache offline. Or set `ACTRONE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai` if you would
rather use a cloud model (see [Privacy and PII](#privacy-and-pii-local-first-by-default-cloud-capable) first).

Each built-in embedder carries the similarity threshold it was calibrated for, because
scores are not comparable across models: the lexical embedder scores relevant text around
0.24, while bge-small scores unrelated text around 0.48. `memory.relevance_threshold` shows
the value in use, and `ACTRONE_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD` overrides it.

### Going to production

Two independent switches. Flip them when you need durability and/or semantic
recall. Both default off so you can start with zero setup.

```bash
# Durable, horizontally-scalable backend (Redis L1 + Qdrant L2)
export ACTRONE_BACKEND=redis_qdrant
export ACTRONE_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
export ACTRONE_QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333

# Semantic embeddings (choose ONE)
export ACTRONE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai        # needs the key below
export ACTRONE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# ...or run fully offline with a real model:
#   pip install "actrone-memory[local]"
#   export ACTRONE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local     # sentence-transformers, no key
```

No code changes. The same `MemoryManager.create()` reads these at startup.

### Which backends are supported?

| Tier | Shipped implementations |
| --- | --- |
| Hot session (L1) | in-process (default), **Redis**, **Postgres** |
| Long-term semantic (L2) | in-process (default), **Qdrant**, **Postgres + pgvector** |

`ACTRONE_BACKEND` selects the two wired-by-env combinations, `memory` or `redis_qdrant`.
The Postgres stores are passed to `create()` directly (see below), because they take a DSN
or a pool you already own.

**Redis-compatible servers work with the Redis adapter unmodified.** It uses only standard
commands (`RPUSH`, `LTRIM`, `LRANGE`, `EXPIRE`, `SET NX EX`, hashes, pipelines), so
**Valkey**, DragonflyDB, ElastiCache and Upstash need no separate adapter. Valkey is covered
by its own integration suite (`tests/integration/test_valkey_compatibility.py`), which runs
the full conformance suite against a real Valkey container rather than assuming it.

#### Postgres, for "no new infrastructure"

If you already run Postgres, both tiers can live there and you add no service at all.
Install `pip install "actrone-memory[pgvector]"`, which needs the
[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension for the long-term tier.

```python
import asyncpg
from actrone_memory import MemoryManager
from actrone_memory.l1.postgres_store import PostgresStore
from actrone_memory.l2.pgvector_store import PgVectorStore

# One pool for both tiers, owned by your application.
pool = await asyncpg.create_pool("postgresql://localhost/mydb")

l1 = PostgresStore.from_pool(pool)
l2 = PgVectorStore.from_pool(pool, dimensions=1536)
await l1.ensure_schema()
await l2.ensure_schema()

memory = await MemoryManager.create(l1=l1, l2=l2)
```

Or let each store own its own pool with `await PostgresStore.from_dsn(dsn)` and
`await PgVectorStore.from_dsn(dsn, dimensions=1536)`.

Postgres has no TTL or list trimming, so the L1 store implements both explicitly: an
`expires_at` column filtered on read and cleaned opportunistically on write, and a retention
cap enforced on append. Honest trade-off: Redis is faster for the hot path, and the long-term
tier is the one where replacing a whole extra service matters most.

#### Bring your own store

The built-in adapters have no privileged access: they implement `L1Store` and `L2Store` like
anything else would. Any engine that can satisfy those `typing.Protocol` seams plugs in
without touching the manager, and the store you pass is used as-is, so no built-in backend is
constructed or connected behind it.

```python
from actrone_memory import MemoryManager

class MyWeaviateStore:            # structural, no subclassing required
    async def upsert(self, entry): ...
    async def search(self, agent_id, query_embedding, threshold, limit=20,
                     content_types=None, query_text=None): ...
    async def delete(self, memory_id): ...
    async def delete_agent_memories(self, agent_id): ...
    async def close(self): ...

memory = await MemoryManager.create(l2=MyWeaviateStore())
```

Two things worth knowing before you write one:

- **Return the embedding with each search hit** if you rank with the bundled `hybrid_rank`
  helper, which recomputes cosine locally. It raises a clear error rather than returning
  silent zeros if none of your candidates carry one. If your database ranks server-side and
  does not return vectors (Pinecone needs `include_values`), use `fuse_channels` with its own
  scores instead, the way `QdrantStore` does.
- **`try_acquire_summary_lock` must be a single atomic operation** (Redis `SET NX EX`,
  Postgres `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... WHERE expires_at <= now()`), never a read then a
  write, or concurrent workers will all summarise the same session.

#### Verifying your own store

To make that a supported extension point rather than a claim, the package ships the same
conformance suite the built-in stores are held to:

```python
import asyncio
from actrone_memory.testing import check_l1_store, check_l2_store

asyncio.run(check_l2_store(lambda: MyWeaviateStore(...), dimensions=1536))
```

It checks the behaviours the type system cannot: turns come back oldest-first, `n` windows
from the end, a search never returns another agent's memories, `threshold`, `limit` and
`content_types` are honoured, an upsert replaces rather than duplicates, erasure is scoped,
and a summary lock admits one holder. Each failure raises `ConformanceError` naming the
requirement. `actrone-memory/testing` is the TypeScript equivalent, against the same
contract, so an adapter in either language is held to the same bar.

The manager does not depend on those classes directly. It depends on two
`typing.Protocol` seams, `L1Store` and `L2Store` (`actrone_memory.protocols`), so any
other engine (pgvector, Weaviate, Pinecone, Valkey, Postgres, and so on) works by
implementing the protocol and passing your instance to `create()`:

```python
from actrone_memory import MemoryManager

class MyPgVectorStore:          # structurally satisfies L2Store, no subclassing needed
    async def upsert(self, entry): ...
    async def search(self, agent_id, query_embedding, threshold, limit=20,
                     content_types=None, query_text=None): ...
    async def delete(self, memory_id): ...
    async def delete_agent_memories(self, agent_id): ...
    async def close(self): ...

memory = await MemoryManager.create(l2=MyPgVectorStore())
```

Anything you inject is used as-is and the matching built-in backend is never built, so
injecting a store opens no connection to Redis or Qdrant. Injecting both stores keeps
the library entirely free of database drivers.

There is no built-in adapter for those other engines and none is planned as a hard
dependency: keeping the base install free of database drivers is the point.

## Privacy and PII: local-first by default, cloud-capable

This library is **local-first by default**: the built-in embedder runs in-process and fact extraction is
opt-in, so with the defaults (`ACTRONE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=hashing`/`local`, extraction off) **nothing leaves
your machine**: no API key, no egress. It is also **cloud-capable**, e.g.
`ACTRONE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`, or any OpenAI-compatible extractor.

**Important, and this is exactly where PII protection holds.** The sensitivity classification (`none/low/pii/sensitive`) is
produced *by* the extraction step, and that step (and any real embedder) sees the **raw** text. So PII
protection here holds **only for local models** (in-process / a local Ollama endpoint, so zero-egress). If you
set a **cloud** provider, the raw text, including PII-classified content, is sent there. This library does
**not** tokenise it first.

Actrone's **hosted** platform adds **MAL (Memory Abstraction Layer)**, which tokenises PII *before* any
inference, a structural guarantee that makes **cloud** models safe (same API, one-import migration). Short
form: **local-first by default; cloud-capable; PII stays protected only on local models; MAL (hosted) makes
cloud safe.**

## How the Memory System Works

Think of it like a human brain. There is a **working memory** for what just happened, and a **long-term memory** for everything else.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        MemoryManager                            │
│                                                                 │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐   ┌───────────────────────────┐  │
│  │     SHORT-TERM (Redis)   │   │    LONG-TERM (Qdrant)     │  │
│  │                          │   │                           │  │
│  │  The last 50 messages    │   │  Compressed summaries     │  │
│  │  of this conversation.   │   │  of older conversations.  │  │

│  │                          │   │  ~10ms. Never expires.    │  │
│  └──────────────────────────┘   └───────────────────────────┘  │
│                                                                 │
│  When you call retrieve_context(), both are searched in         │

│  inside your token budget, automatically.                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What happens when context gets too big?

The library **prioritises intelligently**. It never silently drops important things. It always keeps the most recent messages and the most relevant memories, pruning the least important stuff first.

```text
Your token budget: 4,096 tokens
├── System prompt          ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  30%  (never pruned)
├── Long-term memories     ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  25%  (lowest relevance dropped first)
├── Recent messages        █████████░░░░░░░░░░░  35%  (oldest dropped first)
└── Current user message   ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  10%  (always kept)
```

### Auto-summarisation

After every 20 messages (configurable), the library quietly compresses the conversation into a summary and saves it to long-term memory. This runs in the background, so your users never wait for it.

```text
Message 1  ──┐
Message 2    │
...          │  After 20 messages →  [Summary written to Qdrant]
Message 20 ──┘                           ↑
                                    Available forever, searchable by meaning
```

## Framework Adapters

### Compatibility matrix

Each adapter is an optional extra (`pip install actrone-memory[<framework>]`), tested against the
version range below. Tier 1 = a governed system-context string (framework-free); Tier 2 = the
framework's native memory interface. The base install (`pip install actrone-memory`) is local-first
and pulls **none** of these, nor Redis/Qdrant/OpenAI (those are the `redis`/`qdrant`/`openai`/
`production` extras).

| Framework | Extra | Tested version | Tiers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LangChain | `langchain` | `>=0.2,<3` | 1 + 2 (`BaseChatMessageHistory`; `BaseMemory` on 0.x) |
| LangGraph | `langgraph` | `>=0.1,<2` | 1 + 2 (checkpointer) |
| CrewAI | `crewai` | `>=0.30,<2` | 1 + 2 |
| AutoGen | `autogen` | `>=0.4,<1` | 1 + 2 (`Memory`) |
| LlamaIndex | `llamaindex` | `>=0.10,<2` | 1 + 2 (`Memory`) |
| Haystack | `haystack` | `>=2.0,<3` | 1 + 2 (`@component`) |
| DSPy | `dspy` | `>=2.4,<3` | 1 + 2 (`Retrieve`) |
| Agno | `agno` | `>=1,<2` | 1 (`additional_context`) |
| smolagents | `smolagents` | `>=1,<2` | 1 (task context) |
| AWS Strands | `strands` | `>=1,<2` | 1 (system prompt) |
| OpenAI Agents SDK | `openai_agents` | `>=0.1,<1` | 1 (instructions) |
| Pydantic AI | `pydantic_ai` | `>=0.4,<2` | 1 (system prompt) |
| Claude Agent SDK | `claude_agent_sdk` | `>=0.1,<1` | 1 (system prompt) |
| Semantic Kernel | `semantic_kernel` | `>=1.0,<2` | 1 + 2 (`ChatHistory`) |
| Google ADK | `google_adk` | `>=1.0,<2` | 1 + 2 (`BaseMemoryService`) |
| Microsoft Agent Framework | `microsoft_agent_framework` | `>=1.0,<2` | 1 + 2 (`ContextProvider`) |

#### Security posture of the framework extras

The base install and the `redis` / `qdrant` / `openai` extras carry **no known
vulnerabilities**, and CI audits both sets on every pull request. The framework extras pull
in third-party dependency trees we do not control, so their posture is worth knowing before
you install:

| Extra | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `langchain` | **Resolves clean on 1.x.** This extra spans both majors (`>=0.2,<3`) precisely so you can take LangChain's security fixes, which only exist in the 1.x line. If you pin `langchain-core<1` yourself you stay on 0.3.x, which has published advisories with no 0.3.x fix. |
| `semantic_kernel` | Resolves to `semantic-kernel` 1.36.x and `werkzeug` 3.1.1, both with advisories. Upstream, not our cap: `semantic-kernel` 1.39.4+ requires a pre-release (`azure-ai-agents>=1.2.0b3`) that a normal `pip install` will not take, and `werkzeug` is held down by `openapi-core`. Neither is in a code path this adapter uses. |

If an advisory affects a framework component your own application uses, you can always
install that framework yourself at the version you need and use the **Tier-1** framework-free
context string, which imports no framework at all.

### LangChain: swap in 1 line

LangChain 1.x removed the `BaseMemory` abstraction, so there are two adapters. Reach for
`ActroneChatMessageHistory` unless you are pinned to 0.x: it targets
`BaseChatMessageHistory`, which is unchanged across both majors.

```python
# Works on LangChain 0.x and 1.x
from actrone_memory.integrations.langchain import ActroneChatMessageHistory

history = ActroneChatMessageHistory(agent_id="my-agent", session_id="user-123")
chain = RunnableWithMessageHistory(runnable, lambda _: history)

await chain.ainvoke(
    {"input": "hello"},
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": "user-123"}},
)
```

```python
# LangChain 0.x only: the classic BaseMemory drop-in.
# Raises on 1.x with a pointer to the adapter above.
from actrone_memory.integrations.langchain import ActroneMemory

memory = ActroneMemory(agent_id="my-agent", session_id="user-123")
chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=memory)  # rest of your code unchanged
```

The adapter is async-only because the store is, so drive LangChain through `ainvoke` /
`astream` and the `aget_messages` / `aadd_messages` / `aclear` methods.

### LangGraph: plug-in checkpointer

```python
from actrone_memory.integrations.langgraph import ActroneCheckpointer

checkpointer = ActroneCheckpointer(agent_id="my-agent")
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
# Your graph now remembers state across restarts and sessions
```

### CrewAI: shared crew memory

```python
from actrone_memory.integrations.crewai import ActroneCrewMemory
from crewai import Task

# Each agent in the crew can recall and share findings
memory = ActroneCrewMemory(agent_id="research-crew", session_id="project-alpha")
context = await memory.build_context("competitor pricing")
task = Task(description=f"{context}\n\nSummarise competitor pricing.", agent=researcher)
# ...crew.kickoff(), then store what the crew concluded:
await memory.save(result, {"task_input": "Summarise competitor pricing."})
```

The adapter feeds memory into the task text rather than replacing CrewAI's own memory
storage, so it works the same across CrewAI versions.

## Configuration

Everything is controlled with environment variables, so there are no config files to
write. **Every value below has a working default.** You can run the quickstart without
setting a single one.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACTRONE_BACKEND` | `memory` | `memory` runs fully in-process. Set `redis_qdrant` for the durable backend. |
| `ACTRONE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `local` | `local` (best offline embedder available: ONNX, then sentence-transformers, then hashing), `hashing` (dependency-free, no model download), or `openai`. |
| `ACTRONE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | *(none)* | Required **only** when `ACTRONE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`. Unused otherwise. |
| `ACTRONE_REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379` | Where your Redis is running. Used only when `ACTRONE_BACKEND=redis_qdrant`. |
| `ACTRONE_QDRANT_URL` | `http://localhost:6333` | Where your Qdrant is running. Used only when `ACTRONE_BACKEND=redis_qdrant`. |
| `ACTRONE_SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | `24` | How long short-term memory lasts. |
| `ACTRONE_MAX_SESSION_TURNS` | `50` | Max messages kept in short-term memory. |
| `ACTRONE_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD` | *(calibrated)* | How similar a memory must be before it is included (0 to 1). Unset, each embedder uses its calibrated value: `0.3` lexical, `0.63` bge-small, `0.4` MiniLM, and `0.72` for OpenAI or a custom embedder. |
| `ACTRONE_TOKEN_COUNTER` | `heuristic` | `heuristic` (about 4 characters per token, no network) or `tiktoken` (exact counts; needs `pip install "actrone-memory[tiktoken]"`, which downloads its encoding once). |
| `ACTRONE_AUTO_SUMMARISE` | `true` | Automatically compress old conversations into long-term memory. |
| `ACTRONE_SUMMARISE_AFTER_TURNS` | `20` | How many messages before auto-summarisation runs. |
