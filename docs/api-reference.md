## MemoryManager

This is the main class you'll interact with. It manages both the short-term Redis memory and the long-term Qdrant memory, and handles all the logic of keeping them in sync.

**Never create one directly with `MemoryManager(...)`.** Always use `MemoryManager.create()` or the `create_memory_manager()` context manager shown below — they handle connecting to Redis and Qdrant for you.

---

### `create()`

**What it does:** Connects to Redis and Qdrant, sets up the embedding provider, and returns a ready-to-use `MemoryManager`. Think of it as "opening" the memory system.

```python
@classmethod
async def create(cls, config: MemoryConfig | None = None) -> MemoryManager
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | `MemoryConfig` or `None` | Your settings. If you leave this blank, it reads from environment variables automatically. |

**Returns:** A `MemoryManager` instance, ready to use.

**Can fail with:**

- `ConfigurationError` — if required settings are missing (e.g. you forgot to set `ACTRONE_OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- `StoreConnectionError` — if Redis or Qdrant isn't running or can't be reached

**The two recommended ways to use it:**

```python
# Option A — context manager (recommended)
# The connection closes automatically when the block ends, even if an error occurs.
async with MemoryManager.create() as memory:
    await memory.store_turn(...)
    context = await memory.retrieve_context(...)

# Option B — manual open/close
memory = await MemoryManager.create()
try:
    await memory.store_turn(...)
finally:
    await memory.close()  # always close when you're done
```

---

### `store_turn()`

**What it does:** Saves one exchange between the user and the agent (one "turn") into short-term memory (Redis). If auto-summarisation is enabled, it also quietly triggers a background compression to long-term memory after enough turns accumulate.

```python
async def store_turn(
    agent_id: str,
    session_id: str,
    user_message: str,
    assistant_message: str,
    tool_results: list[ToolResult] | None = None,
) -> str
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_id` | `str` | A unique name for your agent, e.g. `"customer-support-bot"`. This scopes the memory so different agents don't share memories. |
| `session_id` | `str` | A unique ID for this conversation, e.g. the user's ID or a UUID. Each new conversation should get a new session ID. |
| `user_message` | `str` | What the user said. |
| `assistant_message` | `str` | What the agent replied. |
| `tool_results` | list or `None` | Optional. If the agent called any external tools (like a web search), you can store the results here for future reference. |

**Returns:** `str` — the ID of the saved turn (useful if you need to reference it later).

**Can fail with:** `StoreConnectionError` — if Redis is unreachable.

```python
turn_id = await memory.store_turn(
    agent_id          = "support-bot",
    session_id        = "user-abc-123",
    user_message      = "My order hasn't arrived yet.",
    assistant_message = "I'm sorry to hear that! Can you share your order number?",
)
```

---

### `retrieve_context()`

**What it does:** Before your agent replies, call this to get all the relevant memory — recent messages from this session plus any related memories from past sessions — pre-packaged and ready to inject into your LLM prompt.

It runs a 4-phase pipeline (fetch both tiers in parallel → allocate the token budget → rank by relevance → prune to fit) and returns only what fits in your budget.

```python
async def retrieve_context(
    agent_id: str,
    session_id: str,
    query: str,
    token_budget: int,
) -> RetrievedContext
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_id` | `str` | Same agent ID you used in `store_turn()`. |
| `session_id` | `str` | Same session ID you used in `store_turn()`. |
| `query` | `str` | The user's current message. This is used to search long-term memory for relevant past conversations. |
| `token_budget` | `int` | How many tokens you can spare for memory context. Must be greater than 0. A safe default is `4096`. |

**Returns:** `RetrievedContext` — see [Data Types](#data-types) below.

**Can fail with:**

- `TokenBudgetError` — if you pass `token_budget=0` or less
- `StoreConnectionError` — if Redis or Qdrant is unreachable
- `EmbeddingError` — if the embedding API call fails

```python
context = await memory.retrieve_context(
    agent_id     = "support-bot",
    session_id   = "user-abc-123",
    query        = "I still haven't received my order.",
    token_budget = 4096,
)

# Use it to build your LLM prompt
for turn in context.recent_turns:
    print(f"User: {turn.user_message}")
    print(f"Agent: {turn.assistant_message}")

for mem in context.episodic_memories:
    print(f"Relevant memory: {mem.content}")

print(f"Used {context.total_tokens_used} of {context.token_budget} tokens")
```

---

### `inject_memory()`

**What it does:** Manually writes a piece of information directly into long-term memory (Qdrant). Use this to seed an agent with background knowledge before a conversation starts — things like user preferences, company policies, or facts you've collected elsewhere.

```python
async def inject_memory(
    agent_id: str,
    content: str,
    importance: float = 0.8,
    session_id: str = "injected",
    topic_tags: list[str] | None = None,
) -> str
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_id` | `str` | — | The agent that should have access to this memory. |
| `content` | `str` | — | The text to remember. Write it as a clear, self-contained sentence. |
| `importance` | `float` | `0.8` | A score from 0.0 to 1.0. Higher importance means this memory surfaces more readily. Most injected facts should be 0.8 or higher. |
| `session_id` | `str` | `"injected"` | A label for where this memory came from. Can be anything — useful for filtering or debugging. |
| `topic_tags` | list or `None` | `None` | Optional keywords that describe this memory, e.g. `["user-profile", "preferences"]`. |

**Returns:** `str` — the memory ID (save this if you want to delete the memory later).

**Can fail with:** `StoreConnectionError`, `EmbeddingError`

```python
memory_id = await memory.inject_memory(
    agent_id   = "support-bot",
    content    = "This user is a Premium subscriber and prefers email communication over chat.",
    importance = 0.95,
    topic_tags = ["user-profile", "communication-preferences"],
)
```

---

### `delete_memory()`

**What it does:** Permanently removes a specific memory from long-term storage. Useful if you injected incorrect information, or if a user asks you to forget something.

```python
async def delete_memory(agent_id: str, memory_id: str) -> None
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_id` | `str` | The agent that owns this memory (used for audit logging). |
| `memory_id` | `str` | The ID returned when you called `inject_memory()`, or from a `search_memories()` result. |

**Can fail with:** `MemoryNotFoundError` (if the ID doesn't exist), `StoreConnectionError`

```python
await memory.delete_memory(
    agent_id  = "support-bot",
    memory_id = memory_id,  # the ID you got from inject_memory()
)
```

---

### `clear_session()`

**What it does:** Deletes all the short-term (Redis) messages for one session. Useful when a conversation is fully resolved and you want to free up memory.

> **Note:** This only clears short-term Redis memory. Long-term Qdrant memories (summaries and injected facts) are **not** deleted. They persist across sessions by design.

```python
async def clear_session(agent_id: str, session_id: str) -> None
```

```python
await memory.clear_session(agent_id="support-bot", session_id="user-abc-123")
```

---

### `search_memories()`

**What it does:** Searches long-term memory directly using a text query. Returns memories ranked by how closely they match the meaning of your query. Useful for building admin UIs, debugging memory issues, or building features like "show me everything this agent knows about topic X".

```python
async def search_memories(
    agent_id: str,
    query: str,
    limit: int = 10,
) -> list[MemoryEntry]
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_id` | `str` | — | Which agent's memories to search. |
| `query` | `str` | — | What you're looking for, in plain English. |
| `limit` | `int` | `10` | Maximum number of results to return. |

**Returns:** `list[MemoryEntry]` — sorted by relevance, filtered at the configured threshold.

```python
results = await memory.search_memories(
    agent_id = "support-bot",
    query    = "shipping and delivery complaints",
    limit    = 5,
)

for result in results:
    print(f"[{result.content_type}] {result.content}")
```

---

### `get_session_metadata()`

**What it does:** Returns basic stats about a session — when it was created, when it was last active, and how many turns it has. Returns `None` if the session doesn't exist or has expired.

```python
async def get_session_metadata(agent_id: str, session_id: str) -> SessionMetadata | None
```

```python
meta = await memory.get_session_metadata("support-bot", "user-abc-123")
if meta:
    print(f"Session has {meta.turn_count} turns")
    print(f"Last active: {meta.last_active}")
```

---

## Data Types

These are the objects returned by the methods above.

---

### `RetrievedContext`

Returned by `retrieve_context()`. Contains everything you need to build your LLM prompt.

```python
class RetrievedContext:
    recent_turns: list[Turn]          # Messages from this session, newest last
    episodic_memories: list[MemoryEntry]  # Relevant memories from past sessions
    total_tokens_used: int            # How many tokens all this context uses
    token_budget: int                 # The budget you passed in
    retrieval_duration_ms: float      # How long the retrieval took, in milliseconds

    # Computed property:
    budget_utilisation: float         # total_tokens_used / token_budget (e.g. 0.73 = 73%)
```

**How to use it:**

```python
context = await memory.retrieve_context(...)

# Inject recent messages into your prompt
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}]

for turn in context.recent_turns:
    messages.append({"role": "user",      "content": turn.user_message})
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": turn.assistant_message})

# Inject relevant long-term memories as a system note
if context.episodic_memories:
    memory_text = "\n".join(f"- {m.content}" for m in context.episodic_memories)
    messages.insert(1, {
        "role": "system",
        "content": f"Relevant memories:\n{memory_text}"
    })

# Current user message
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": current_user_message})
```

---

### `Turn`

A single back-and-forth exchange between user and agent.

```python
class Turn:
    id: str                         # Unique ID for this turn
    session_id: str
    user_message: str               # What the user said
    assistant_message: str          # What the agent replied
    tool_results: list[ToolResult]  # Any tool calls made during this turn
    timestamp: datetime             # When this turn happened (UTC)
    token_count: int                # Total tokens in this turn
```

---

### `MemoryEntry`

A single item stored in long-term memory (Qdrant). Could be a compressed summary, an injected fact, or a tool result.

```python
class MemoryEntry:
    id: str                # Unique ID — use this with delete_memory()
    agent_id: str
    session_id: str
    content: str           # The actual text of the memory
    content_type: str      # One of: "turn", "summary", "tool_result", "injected"
    importance_score: float   # 0.0–1.0 — how important this memory is
    topic_tags: list[str]  # Keywords describing this memory
    token_count: int
    timestamp: datetime    # When this memory was created (UTC)
    source_turn_ids: list[str]  # Which turns this memory was derived from
```

---

### `ToolResult`

Represents the result of an external tool call (e.g. a web search, database query, or API call).

```python
class ToolResult:
    tool_name: str             # Name of the tool that was called
    params: dict               # What was passed to the tool
    result: object             # What the tool returned
    success: bool              # Whether the call succeeded
    duration_ms: int | None    # How long the call took
```

---

### `SessionMetadata`

Basic stats about a session, returned by `get_session_metadata()`.

```python
class SessionMetadata:
    agent_id: str
    session_id: str
    turn_count: int            # How many turns this session has
    created_at: datetime | None
    last_active: datetime | None
```

---

## MemoryConfig

All configuration is read from environment variables automatically. You can also create a `MemoryConfig` object explicitly if you prefer not to use environment variables.

```python
from actrone_memory import MemoryConfig

config = MemoryConfig(
    redis_url          = "redis://localhost:6379",
    qdrant_url         = "http://localhost:6333",
    openai_api_key     = "sk-...",
    session_ttl_hours  = 48,
    max_session_turns  = 100,
)

async with MemoryManager.create(config) as memory:
    ...
```

**All available settings:**

| Setting | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `redis_url` | `ACTRONE_REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379` | Where your Redis server is running |
| `qdrant_url` | `ACTRONE_QDRANT_URL` | `http://localhost:6333` | Where your Qdrant server is running |
| `qdrant_api_key` | `ACTRONE_QDRANT_API_KEY` | `None` | API key for Qdrant Cloud (not needed for self-hosted) |
| `embedding_provider` | `ACTRONE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `openai` | Use `"local"` to run without internet or an API key |
| `openai_api_key` | `ACTRONE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | `None` | Required when `embedding_provider = "openai"` |
| `session_ttl_hours` | `ACTRONE_SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | `24` | How many hours before short-term memory expires |
| `max_session_turns` | `ACTRONE_MAX_SESSION_TURNS` | `50` | Maximum messages stored in short-term memory per session |
| `relevance_threshold` | `ACTRONE_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD` | `0.72` | How similar a memory must be to the query before it's included (0.0–1.0). Raise this to be more selective. |
| `auto_summarise` | `ACTRONE_AUTO_SUMMARISE` | `true` | Automatically compress old conversations into long-term memory |
| `summarise_after_turns` | `ACTRONE_SUMMARISE_AFTER_TURNS` | `20` | Trigger summarisation after this many turns |

**Token budget fractions** (these must add up to exactly 1.0):

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `budget_fraction_system` | `0.30` | Fraction reserved for the system prompt |
| `budget_fraction_episodic` | `0.25` | Fraction for long-term memories |
| `budget_fraction_session` | `0.35` | Fraction for recent session messages |
| `budget_fraction_current_turn` | `0.10` | Fraction for the current user message |

---

## Errors

All errors extend `ActroneMemoryError`, so you can catch everything with one handler or be specific:

```python
from actrone_memory.exceptions import (
    ActroneMemoryError,    # catch-all base class
    ConfigurationError,    # bad or missing settings
    StoreConnectionError,  # Redis or Qdrant unreachable
    EmbeddingError,        # embedding API failed
    MemoryNotFoundError,   # delete_memory() got a non-existent ID
    TokenBudgetError,      # token_budget was 0 or negative
)

# Catch everything:
try:
    context = await memory.retrieve_context(...)
except ActroneMemoryError as e:
    print(f"Memory error [{e.code}]: {e.message}")

# Or be specific and handle each case:
try:
    context = await memory.retrieve_context(...)
except StoreConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Could not reach {e.store} — falling back to empty context")
    context = empty_context
except EmbeddingError:
    print("Embedding failed — retrying without semantic search")
```

**Every error includes:**

- `e.code` — a machine-readable identifier (e.g. `"ERR_STORE_CONNECTION"`) — useful for logging
- `e.message` — a human-readable description of what went wrong

| Error | Code | When it's raised |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ConfigurationError` | `ERR_CONFIGURATION` | A required setting is missing or invalid when you call `MemoryManager.create()` |
| `StoreConnectionError` | `ERR_STORE_CONNECTION` | Redis or Qdrant can't be reached |
| `EmbeddingError` | `ERR_EMBEDDING` | The embedding API (OpenAI) returned an error |
| `MemoryNotFoundError` | `ERR_MEMORY_NOT_FOUND` | You called `delete_memory()` with an ID that doesn't exist |
| `TokenBudgetError` | `ERR_TOKEN_BUDGET` | You passed `token_budget=0` or a negative number |

---

## Framework Integrations

### LangChain

Drop-in replacement for `ConversationBufferMemory`. The rest of your LangChain code stays exactly the same.

```python
from actrone_memory.integrations.langchain import ActroneMemory

memory = ActroneMemory(
    agent_id     = "my-agent",
    session_id   = "user-session-1",
    token_budget = 4096,            # optional, default 4096
)

# Use it anywhere LangChain expects a memory object:
chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=memory)
response = await chain.ainvoke({"input": "Hello!"})
```

### LangGraph

```python
from actrone_memory.integrations.langgraph import ActroneCheckpointer

checkpointer = ActroneCheckpointer(
    agent_id     = "my-agent",
    token_budget = 4096,
)

graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
# Your graph now persists state across sessions and restarts
```

### CrewAI

```python
from actrone_memory.integrations.crewai import ActroneCrewMemory
from crewai import Agent

# Agents sharing the same agent_id and session_id share memory
memory = ActroneCrewMemory(
    agent_id   = "research-crew",
    session_id = "project-alpha",
)

agent = Agent(
    role           = "Researcher",
    memory         = True,
    memory_backend = memory,
)
```

See the [`examples/`](../examples/) folder for fully working scripts.
