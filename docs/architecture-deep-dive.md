## The Core Problem: AI Agents Have No Memory

When you talk to an AI, everything you say is sent to the language model as a single block of text called the **context window**. Think of it as a piece of paper — the AI can only see what's written on that one page.

Two problems come from this:

1. **The page has a size limit.** Most models cap out at 8,000 to 128,000 tokens (roughly 6,000–100,000 words). In a long conversation, old messages fall off the page.
2. **The page is thrown away after every session.** Start a new conversation and the AI has no idea who you are.

`actrone-memory` fixes both problems by giving agents two types of memory — one for what just happened, one for everything ever said.

## The Two-Tier Memory System

Inspired by how computers use RAM and a hard drive, we use two different storage systems with different trade-offs.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                     │
│   SHORT-TERM MEMORY                    LONG-TERM MEMORY             │
│   ─────────────────                    ────────────────             │
│   Redis (in-memory database)           Qdrant (vector database)     │
│                                                                     │
│   Like RAM in a computer:              Like a hard drive:           │
│   • Lightning fast (< 1ms)             • Fast (~10ms)               │
│   • Stores raw recent messages         • Stores compressed history  │
│   • Expires after 24 hours             • Keeps data forever         │
│   • Holds last 50 messages             • Searches by meaning        │
│                                                                     │
│   "What did we just talk about?"       "Have we ever talked         │
│                                         about this topic before?"   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why Two Tiers?

You could store everything in one place, but no single system is perfect for both jobs:

- **Redis** is extremely fast but stores data in raw text and doesn't understand meaning. You can't ask it "find everything we talked about related to trading" — you'd have to search message by message.
- **Qdrant** understands meaning through something called **vector embeddings** (explained below), but it's slower and is designed for search, not for storing ordered lists of recent messages.

Using both gives you speed *and* intelligence.

---

## Vector Embeddings: Search by Meaning, Not Keywords

This is the magic that makes long-term memory useful.

When a new message comes in, we convert it into a list of numbers (called an **embedding vector**) that captures the *meaning* of the text. Similar topics produce similar number patterns, even if the exact words are different.

```text
"I'm building a stock trading bot"
        │
        ▼  (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
        │
[0.021, -0.418, 0.093, 0.671, ...]  ← 1,536 numbers representing the meaning
        │
        ▼
Stored in Qdrant alongside the original text
```

Later, when the user asks "What are the risks of algorithmic trading?", we embed *that* question and find the stored memories whose number patterns are closest — even though the exact words were different. This is called **cosine similarity**.

```text
Query:   "What are the risks of algorithmic trading?"
         [0.019, -0.401, 0.087, 0.658, ...]

Memory:  "I'm building a stock trading bot"
         [0.021, -0.418, 0.093, 0.671, ...]

Similarity score: 0.94  ✓  (above 0.72 threshold — included)


Query:   "What are the risks of algorithmic trading?"
         [0.019, -0.401, 0.087, 0.658, ...]

Memory:  "My cat's name is Whiskers"
         [-0.312, 0.891, -0.445, 0.123, ...]

Similarity score: 0.11  ✗  (below threshold — excluded)
```

The **threshold** (default 0.72) is a quality gate — only memories that are genuinely relevant to the current question get included.

## The Retrieval Pipeline: Step by Step

Every time your agent needs to reply, you call `retrieve_context()`. Here is exactly what happens inside:

```text
You call: retrieve_context(query="What risks should I worry about?", token_budget=4096)
                │
                │
    ┌───────────▼───────────┐
    │   STEP 1: Fetch       │  Both happen at the same time (in parallel)
    │   (takes ~10ms)       │  so you don't wait twice.
    │                       │
    │  Redis ──────────────►│  "Give me the last 50 messages"
    │  Qdrant ─────────────►│  "Find memories similar to this query"
    └───────────┬───────────┘
                │
    ┌───────────▼───────────┐
    │   STEP 2: Allocate    │  Decide how to divide the token budget.
    │   the budget          │
    │                       │
    │  System prompt   30%  │  ← Your agent's instructions. Sacred, never cut.
    │  Long-term mem   25%  │  ← Relevant memories from past conversations.
    │  Recent messages 35%  │  ← What was said in this session.
    │  Current message 10%  │  ← What the user just sent.
    └───────────┬───────────┘
                │
    ┌───────────▼───────────┐
    │   STEP 3: Rank        │  Score each memory using two signals:
    │                       │
    │  Score = (0.7 × how   │  • Relevance: how closely it matches the query
    │           relevant)   │  • Recency: how recently it was created
    │        + (0.3 × how   │
    │           recent)     │  A memory from today scores higher than an equally
    │                       │  relevant memory from 3 weeks ago.
    └───────────┬───────────┘
                │
    ┌───────────▼───────────┐
    │   STEP 4: Prune       │  If we still have too much to fit in the budget,
    │                       │  cut the lowest-priority items first:
    │  1. Oldest messages   │  ← dropped first (least relevant to now)
    │  2. Low-ranked mem    │  ← dropped next (least relevant to query)
    │  3. System prompt     │  ← NEVER dropped
    └───────────┬───────────┘
                │
                ▼
    RetrievedContext ready to inject into your LLM prompt ✓
```

## Auto-Summarisation: Compressing Old Conversations

After every 20 messages (configurable), a **background process** kicks in and compresses the conversation into a short summary, which gets saved to Qdrant. The process runs silently — users never wait for it.

```text
Session: 20 messages exchanged
              │
              ▼
    ┌─────────────────────┐
    │  Background task    │   Runs after the reply is sent — no delay for users
    │  kicks in           │
    └────────┬────────────┘
             │
             ▼
    Fetch the 20 messages from Redis
             │
             ▼
    Compress them into a summary paragraph
             │
             ▼
    Convert summary to embedding vector
             │
             ▼
    Save to Qdrant as a "summary" memory entry
             │
             ▼
    ✓  Now searchable in all future sessions
```

This means that even if the Redis short-term memory expires (after 24 hours), the compressed knowledge from that conversation lives on in Qdrant forever.

## The Embedding Cache: Avoiding Redundant API Calls

Converting text to an embedding vector costs money (a fraction of a cent per call) and takes ~100ms. If we embed the same text twice, we're wasting both.

The library caches every embedding in Redis with a 7-day expiry:

```text
embed("What is the capital of France?")
         │
         ├──► Check Redis cache
         │         │
         │    HIT ─┤─► Return cached vector instantly  (< 1ms, costs $0)
         │         │
         │   MISS ─┤─► Call OpenAI API                 (~100ms, ~$0.00002)
         │              │
         │              ▼
         │         Save to Redis cache (expires in 7 days)
         │              │
         └──────────────►  Return vector
```

## Data Flow: The Full Picture

## Concurrency and Safety

The library is safe to use in a high-traffic application:

- **Multiple users simultaneously** — each `(agent_id, session_id)` pair is completely isolated. User A's memory never leaks into User B's context.
- **Multiple async tasks** — built on Python's `asyncio`. You can call `store_turn()` and `retrieve_context()` from many coroutines at the same time without conflicts.
- **Background tasks** — auto-summarisation runs as a fire-and-forget background task. If it fails (e.g. a network blip), the error is logged and silently swallowed. It never crashes your main application.
